# Support vector machine

Support vector machines is a just fancy name for sepetaring points in some general dimension with a plane.

Depending on the type of your kernel that plane can take many shapes.

The one initially used in this lab is a linjear plane.

The lab is broken in some ways. And part of the lab is working through and fixing it and improving the classifier.

Initially we are using 'bad.txt' and 'good.txt' as data sources but later one we will use bigger files that have more data and it will make it easier for our classifier to do a good job.

If you have followed the previous instructions and have everything set-up for the lab you can run the program with:
`python spamFilterLab.py`
