# Interactive K-means

This version is for you to see what is actually going on when you are runing K-Means.

There are a few things you should pay attention to!

In every machine learning algorithm there is a bias, can you find this versions bias? *Hint* it is not in the main file!!

Also check the data by just running ´pyhon main.py´!

It will run the alroithm and show you what is happening behind the scenes plotted out.

One you have run it and read the code and understand what the different steps does it is time to start changing the code!

## Change the number of centroids.

For us humans we can figure out that there is 3 parts of the data so the number of centroids should be 3 right!!?

But what happens when you have 3 and look at the evaluation later. Do you get 100%?

What would be an appropriate number of centroids?

## Change the starting points of your centroids
