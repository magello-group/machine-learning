In this lab we will use the K-Means algorithm to reduce the colors in an image.

Apart from python we we use two external libraries:

h2. Numpy

The central feature of Numpy is the array object class. Arrays are similar to lists in Python,
except that every element of an array must be of the same type, typically a numeric type like
float or int. Arrays make operations with large amounts of numeric data very fast and are
generally much more efficient than lists.

You will use numpy to transform the image bitmap into an array which python can work with.
After you have run your ML algorithm numpy will transform the array back to an image bitmap
which can be displayed.

h2. OpenCV

OpenCV is an Open Source Computer Vision library which contains implementations of several
Machine Learning algorithms, as well as functionality to display and manipulate images.
